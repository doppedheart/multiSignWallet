# Multi-Signature Wallet Implementation README

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a multi-signature wallet on a blockchain using Hardhat. Multi-signature wallets, often referred to as multisig wallets, require multiple signatures (or approvals) to authorize a transaction, providing added security compared to single-signature wallets.

## Features
- Creation of multi-signature wallets
- Addition and removal of signatories
- Authorization of transactions by required signatories

## Getting Started
To get started with this implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-sign-wallet.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then install Hardhat and required plugins by running:
    ```
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
    npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
    ```
3. **Configure Settings**: Adjust any configuration settings as needed. This might include specifying the number of required signatories, blockchain network settings, etc. Configuration can be done in the `hardhat.config.js` file.
4. **Run the Application**: Execute the application by running Hardhat tasks. For example, to compile the contracts, run:
    ```
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
5. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the smart contracts to a blockchain network. For example, to deploy to a local Hardhat network, run:
    ```
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```
6. **Interact with the Wallet**: Once the contracts are deployed, interact with the multi-signature wallet functionalities. This includes creating a wallet, adding/removing signatories, and authorizing transactions.
7. **Test**: Perform thorough testing to ensure the functionality operates as expected. Hardhat supports testing using Mocha and Chai. Run tests using:
    ```
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Usage
Here are the basic steps to utilize the multi-signature wallet:

1. **Create a Wallet**: Use the provided functionality to create a new multi-signature wallet. This typically involves specifying the required number of signatories.
2. **Add Signatories**: Add authorized signatories to the wallet. Each signatory will have the ability to approve transactions.
3. **Initiate a Transaction**: Begin a transaction by specifying the details such as the recipient and the amount.
4. **Sign the Transaction**: Sign the transaction with the required number of signatories. Ensure that the transaction receives the necessary number of approvals.
5. **Execute the Transaction**: Once the required number of signatories have approved the transaction, execute it to transfer the funds.
6. **Monitor and Manage**: Continuously monitor the wallet for transactions and manage signatories as needed.
